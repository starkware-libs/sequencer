name: Trigger-Workflow

# This workflow exists to trigger the upload_artifacts workflow on both pull requests and push
# events. It solves the issue of forked PRs not having access to secrets. Since external
# contributors don’t have permission to access secrets, this dummy workflow runs with their
#  privileges and triggers the upload_artifacts workflow via the workflow_run event.
# The upload_artifacts workflow runs in the context of the main branch, where it has access to
# the necessary secrets for uploading artifacts, providing a secure solution for managing artifacts
# in forked PRs.
