# Alert Override Configuration
# This file contains environment-specific overrides for alert rule placeholders.
# 
# All placeholders use the generic format: $$$KEY$$$
# The key in this YAML file must match the placeholder key exactly (case-sensitive).
#
# Example:
#   In JSON: "severity": "$$$BATCHED_TRANSACTIONS_STUCK-SEVERITY$$$"
#   In YAML: BATCHED_TRANSACTIONS_STUCK-SEVERITY: "p5"
#
# The placeholder $$$BATCHED_TRANSACTIONS_STUCK-SEVERITY$$$ will be replaced with "p5"
#
# Note: For numeric values, provide the numeric value in YAML. The system will
# automatically convert it back to a number during processing if needed.

# Generic placeholder overrides
