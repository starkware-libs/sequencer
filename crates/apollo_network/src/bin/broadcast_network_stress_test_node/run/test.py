"""
Test script for network protocols: Gossipsub, SQMR, and ReveresedSqmr.

This script:
1. Runs the broadcast network stress test with different protocols
2. Waits 60 seconds for messages to be exchanged
3. Verifies network connections are established via network_connected_peers metric
4. Analyzes sent vs received message metrics to identify broadcaster vs receiver issues
5. Checks for successful message reception and provides detailed failure diagnostics
6. Cleans up the running process

Usage:
    cd /home/andrew/workspace/sequencer/crates/apollo_network/src/bin/broadcast_network_stress_test_node/run

    # Test all protocols
    python3 test.py

    # Test specific protocol
    python3 test.py --protocol gossipsub
    python3 test.py --protocol sqmr
    python3 test.py --protocol reversed-sqmr

The test supports three protocols:
- Gossipsub: Traditional pub/sub broadcasting
- SQMR: Query/response protocol where broadcaster sends queries
- ReveresedSqmr: Query/response protocol where receivers send queries
